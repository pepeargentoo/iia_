this repository was created to test the detection models and understand how face detection works with opencv
## install dependency:
```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt

or 

python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## use 
```
python3 main.py
```

#### Notes:
The next thing would be to find another model for age detection that works better :)
